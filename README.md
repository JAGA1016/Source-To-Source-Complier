# Source To Source Compiler

- In this project, I designed and implemented a Source-to-Source compiler using Lex and Yacc to facilitate the
conversion of code written in Simple Intermediate Language (SIL) into equivalent code in the C programming
language.
- The main objectives of the project were to perform thorough syntax and semantic analysis of the
SIL code, generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and output well-formed C code.


# Project folder contents 
Sample tests(sub folder)

contains testcases

compiler.y (yacc file)

compiler.l  (lex file)

declarations.h

definitions.h

parsetree.h

utils.h

README.md

Makefile  
   
compiler(executable) generated after compiling the programme.

Output.c (generated code)

Output (.c executable generated after compiling the c programme)

# For evaluation: 

Input is taken from terminal 
output of c-code will be there  in output.c
Syntax tree will be printed in the terminal 

###  Note:
i changed the test case 1 bin_search sil 'end' is he token in my language in binary search function i changed the variable name .
$$MakeFile$$

make all --> generates an executable compiler 

make run --> runs the executable compiler and generates c-code into the output.c file and syntax tree will be printed into the terminal 

make exec --> compiles the generated c-code and produces an executable named output

make runc --> runs the executable generated by the gcc

make clean --> removes all the intermediate files created during execution of the programme.
